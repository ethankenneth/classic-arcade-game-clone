index.html, app.js, and README.md files edited by Ethan Kenneth.

*To Run*
Download all folders/files, then open the index.html file in your favorite browser (ctrl+o).

*To Play*
Use the arrow keys to move your player around the screen, avoiding the bugs. The goal is to get to the water. If you are squashed by a bug, you must start over. If you reach the water, you have won, and the game will restart.
